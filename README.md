Manufacturing Unit Dashboard Analysis Report Executive Summary This report presents a comprehensive analysis of three Business Intelligence dashboards (Excel, Power BI, and Tableau) created for manufacturing analytics. Each dashboard visualizes key production metrics, quality control data, and operational performance indicators across multiple departments and time periods. Module 1: Excel Dashboard Analysis The Excel dashboard presents a dark-themed, professional interface with real-time manufacturing metrics and comprehensive filtering capabilities.

Summary Metrics:

Total Manufacturing QTY: 49.79M units
Total Rejected QTY: 0.49M units (approximately 0.98% rejection rate)
Total Processed QTY: 60.02M units
Total Wastage QTY: 10.23M units
Key Visualizations:

Employee Wise Rejected Qty: Consistent quality control across employees
Manufacture VS Rejected: Stable output and rejection rate
Department Wise Manufactured & Rejected: Footwear leads in production
Production VS Rejection Trend: Seasonal dips observed
Top 10 Machine Wise Rejected: MC027, MC026 require maintenance Module 2: Power BI Dashboard Analysis Modern, blue-toned interface with enhanced interactivity and drill-downs.
Summary Metrics:

Total Manufactured Qty: 50M units
Total Rejected Qty: 491K units (0.98% rejection rate)
Total Processed Qty: 60M units
Active Machines: 87
Total Work Orders: 10K
Key Insights:

Consistent monthly production trends
Employee rejection analysis through donut chart
MoM variance analysis reveals performance trends
Department-wise comparison highlights consistency
Machine rejection data aids maintenance planning Module 3: Tableau Dashboard Analysis Emphasizes data exploration with a clean, light-themed design.
Summary Metrics:

Total Manufactured Qty: 49.79M units
Total Rejected Qty: 491.02K units
Rejected Rate: 0.99%
Average Processed Qty: 6.00K units
Total Wastage: 445.99K units
Key Insights:

Clear visualization of production vs. rejection
Department-wise bubble chart comparison
Delivery performance nearly equally distributed
Machine-wise rejection identification
Employee-wise rejection for performance tracking Comparative Analysis Across Platforms All dashboards maintain data consistency with ~50M units manufactured and ~491K rejections (~1% rate).
Excel: Strong filtering and time-series analysis. Power BI: Excellent interactivity and variance tracking. Tableau: Intuitive data exploration and clean visuals. Key Findings & Insights Production Quality: Consistent rejection rate <1%, balanced employee performance. Operational Efficiency: High-performing departments, machine-specific rejections. Delivery: 33% on-time delivery, indicating improvement potential. Recommendations Immediate Actions:

Prioritize maintenance for MC027, MC026, MC094
Address February & October production anomalies
Improve on-time delivery to 50%+
Strategic Initiatives:

Implement Six Sigma/Lean Manufacturing
Reduce wastage to 15%
Integrate BI platforms for multi-level reporting Conclusion Dashboards effectively visualize manufacturing KPIs with consistent data quality. Excel, Power BI, and Tableau collectively support informed, data-driven decision-making. Opportunities lie in delivery optimization and wastage reduction for enhanced operational efficiency.
